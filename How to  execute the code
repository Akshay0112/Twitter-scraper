Set up MongoDB:

Install MongoDB on your local machine or use a remote MongoDB server. Make sure MongoDB is running.
Modify the code:

Replace the placeholders in the code with your Twitter API credentials and MongoDB connection details. Update the consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret, and MongoDB connection URL in the code.
Save the code:

Save the code in a Python file with a .py extension, such as twitter_scraper.py.
Run the code:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.
Execute the following command to run the code:
arduino

streamlit run twitter_scraper.py
Access the Streamlit app:

After running the command, a local server will start, and the Streamlit app will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

In the Streamlit app, enter the keyword or hashtag to search for tweets.
Select the date range and tweet count.
Click the "Scrape and Download" button to retrieve the tweet data and download it as a CSV file.
Note: Make sure you have a stable internet connection and the necessary permissions and access levels for using the Twitter API and accessing MongoDB.
